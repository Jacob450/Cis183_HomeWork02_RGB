 Homework 2 rgb
This program will allow the user to slide 3 different seekbars and produce a color based of the three seekbar values (red, green, and blue) (valid values for red, green and blue are from 0-255)
As the user slides the seekbars the background color of the application will change to match the color.
The RGB color will also be shown in a hexadecimal representation
The user will have the ability to save the color to an arraylist and view that color in a listview.
If the user selects the color from the listview all of the sliders, the hexadecimal representation, and the background color will change to the specified color.
The user is allowed to store as many colors as they want.
After the user saves the color the seekbars, background color, and hexadecimal value will all be set back to either black or white.
If the color is too dark and the user cannot see the text, the text color will switch to white.
If the color is too light and the user cannot see the text, the text color will switch to black.
